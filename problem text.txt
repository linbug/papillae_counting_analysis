I have some count data that quantifies hair density on treated and untreated plants. I am unsure of the best way of analysing these data, based on some features of the dataset.

There are three levels: 

- the uppermost tier is the treatment (control/treatment 1/treatment 2). 
- The second tier describes the individual plants that received each treatment (2-8 plants per treatment). 
- The third tier describes replicate leaves for the hair counting (2-8 replicates per plant). 

For the control plants, there are only really two tiers. This is because all of the plants (including the treatment plants) started off as genetically identical (clones), so I am considering the control replicates to be in the same tier as the individual treatment plants.

To add further complexity, several of these readings are 0 (i.e. there were no hairs observed at all).

I think I want some equivalent of a nested ANOVA to test whether there's a significant difference in means among groups. My question is what would an appropriate test be given: 1. The extremely unbalanced design 2. The zero frequency data?
